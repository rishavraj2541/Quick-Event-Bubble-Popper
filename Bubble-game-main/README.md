#Quick Event Bubble Popper

Quick Event Bubble Popper is a super fun game that mixes quick reflexes with a bit of luck. Your mission? Pop as many bubbles as you can before the timer runs out. Each bubble has a random value, and if you pop one that matches the target number, you score a point. Pop a bubble with a different number, and you get nothing. The game wraps up when time’s up or when you’ve popped all the bubbles.

This game is a cool way to get your hands dirty with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while having a blast. It’s perfect for players of all ages.

#Challenges I Faced
The trickiest part was nailing the bubble popping animation. I wanted it to be satisfying but not too slow or too fast. Also, making sure the bubbles didn’t pop too close together was crucial to keep the game running smoothly.



#Future Plans
I’ve got big plans for Quick Event Bubble Popper! I want to add more types of bubbles, like ones that explode or stick to the screen. I’m also thinking about adding levels so players can progress and unlock new features.

I hope you have a blast with Quick Event Bubble Popper!
